Given that this course is tailored mainly for PhD students some minimal knowledge of statistics will be assumed. By minimal I do mean minimal. We will first start by introducing R and RStudio together and I will frequently be saying just R or just RStudio but in reality I will be implying using RStudio to carry out R commands. Once you are introduced to R and RStudio we will then move to get familiarised to variables, vectors, dataframes, operations, and calculations. Many argue that you cannot teach the use of R without teaching programming. I disagree, and we will be doing very minimal, almost no programming at all. This is thanks to packages and functions that will be doing the heavy lifting for us. We will therefore learn how to install and use additional packages and benefit from their supply of functions. For example today we will be doing lots of work with data. This is because most of our work involves data preparation before we even carry out any analysis. We will therefore manipulating data using a famous package collection called tidyverse and most specifically dplyr and tidyr. It is through this work that you will become more confident and warm up to R. Once we are happy with how our data files look, we will proceed to data visualisations using another powerful package called ggplot2. This is also included in the tidyverse collection. Finally, we will open the floor to more practice examples and questions for you. You can even try todays techniques to some of your own data files and ask me questions in the process. This will conclude the first session and prepare us for the next session where we will be carrying out different types of analysis. "]]
