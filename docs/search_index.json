Part I 7.1 Reflecting on Day 1 In Day 1, we generally introduced individual packages and functions. We also introduced Tidyverse, or to be fair, some aspects of it. In Day 2, the approach will be different. Our work will be aim driven and in each of the following sessions we will have a driving aim. 7.2 Learning Objectives Working with the datafile alcohol_exp.csv we want to bring the dataset to a form where we could carry out analysis of variance (analyses if we want to be precise). This dataset includes a number of variables. Below we will discuss those of interest. We will exclude some of the variables as they were generated by Psychopy and are actual psychological variables. A few words on the dataset variables Participant: a unique id that was assigned to each participant. This should be numeric. group: participants were either assigned to manipulation group 1 or 2. Group 1 did mindfulness meditation, group 2 did not (This is in practice the same variable as meditation). This variable should be a factor. session: each participant completed the experimental task twice. Once before the manipulation and once after. This should also be a factor. image: The image file that was shown during a trial of the experiment. In total 16 different images, eight alcohol related and eight neutral. We can tell if an image is alcohol related if they include the character 1 before the .jpg part. If the character is 2 then the image was neutral. duration: We have a total of seven durations (in seconds). These are 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6. These can be treated as factor or as numerical. We will discuss the difference during the session. response: during each trial participants had to respond by pressing either s or l depending on whether they felt the stimulus stayed on the screen for short or long duration. This is a character variable but we should convert it to numerical so we can extract mean responses. meditation: discussed above, the same as group. This should be a factor. gender: self-explanatory age: self-explanatory A few words on the design For the above, we can say that participant, group, meditation, are between-subjects variables. Whereas, session, image, duration, are within-subjects variables. Our ultimate aim here is to carry out a four-way ANOVA with meditation, session, image, and duration as our IVs and response as our DV. Traditionally, you would need to have your file in the wide format to carry our this analysis in SPSS, where you would employ repeated measures and then declare your between-subjects variables. R operates in a different way, we have to have our dataset in the long format where our measurement in only in one column. We have to keep that in mind while we are working through the dataset. Our dataset should look like this just before our analysis: Steps to take We are keeping variables participant, meditation, and session. Although we changed their location in the dataset (we will use the function relocate()). We have a new variable called salience, this was created from the information included in the variable image (we will use plenty of exciting toys here such as mutate(), str_sub(), and case_when()). We have a new variable called durationms, this is duration in ms (pretty much multiplied duration by 1000). We have a new variable called ratio. Here we will have to carry out the bulk of the work. We will need to group and aggregate our data after we have numerical value instead of a character one for our response. Functions to be used mutate() str_sub() case_when() as.factor() (and other as.type functions) relocate() group_by() summarise() ungroup() (and possibly some others too) Packages to be used 1. tidyverse 2. rstatix 7.3 Working with the file At this point it is best to start a new project and call it Day 2. Once you have that up and running then create our first script for the day, I suggest naming it 4wANOVA. Let us start by loading the data file and checking that our variables are of the correct type. library(tidyverse) library(rstatix) ## load the data file to the dataframe called exp exp &lt;- read_csv(&quot;alcohol_exp.csv&quot;) ##inspect exp head(exp) ## contrary to Day 1 approach we will not be constantly creating new dataframes ## we will create only one new dataframe called exp2 ## lets begin by assigning correct variable types exp2 &lt;- exp %&gt;% mutate(group = as.factor(group)) %&gt;% mutate(session = as.factor(session)) %&gt;% mutate(meditation = as.factor(meditation)) %&gt;% mutate(gender = as.factor(gender)) %&gt;% mutate(group = as.factor(group)) Our variables should fine for now. Looking at the image provided, we want participant, meditation, and session to be the first three variables. Group seems to have been dropped. We will move meditation to the third column and group to the last one. ## we will continue working on the dataframe "]]
